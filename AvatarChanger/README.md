# AvatarChanger - [Download](https://github.com/AbdullahM0hamed/Aliucord-Plugins/raw/builds/AvatarChanger.zip)

Allows you to modify server icons and profile pictures client-side.

## Steps
1: Go to a user's profile (or a server's options by holding the servee icon, and then pressing more options)
2: Scroll down and press "Edit User Avatar" (or "Edit Server Icon")
3: Press "Change Avatar"
4: Add your link and press "Confirm"

To revert an icon or avatar (remove modified version), simply press the "Revert User Avatar" (or "Revert Server Icon") that becomes available for users/servers with modified inages.

Changes may not be applied immediately, as they are only applied when the app decides ro get the image URL. You can make changes be applied by doing one of the following:

• If you have modified a server icon, you can go to the servee by tapping its icon (or change to a different server, if you already on that server)
• For users, you may scroll up/down (till the user is out of the screen) and then back
• You can restart
